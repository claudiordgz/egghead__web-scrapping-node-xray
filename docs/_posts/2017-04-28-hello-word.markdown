title: How it all began

I remember watching videos in gametrailers and screwattack. On ScrewAttack there were still skits by Handsome Tom doing his 'Useless knowledge' bits.

I remember hearing a sound that deafened everything else, every noise was made non existent by the melody. It was the perfect blend of what I needed and what I wanted. 

That day I discovered something that would help me overcome most problems in my next years. 

I changed careers, I changed countries, I got married, and finished projects.

All with OCReMix music right by my side.

This is my thank you, and this is where it starts, but not where it ends.
