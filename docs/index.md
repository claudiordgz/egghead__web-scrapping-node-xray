# How it all began

It's hard to remember the genesis of things. I was watching some videos in the now defunct gametrailers.com and some other in screwattack in youtube back when Handsome Tom was still doing his 'Useless knowledge' bits.

I remember hearing a sound that deafened everything else. It was the perfect blend of what I needed and what I wanted. 

That day I discovered something that would help me overcome most problems in life. 

I changed careers, I changed countries, I got married, and finished projects.

All with OCReMix music right by my side.

This is my thank you, and this is where it starts, but not where it ends.
